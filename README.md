# EQ-Depression-chances-Prediction

The study aims to measure the emotional intelligence of the young people who will recently transition into working domain to find out the significant differences on emotional intelligence on the basis of age group of 20-24. A sample of 211 students were selected of different engineering background from various colleges. Standard emotional intelligence and big five factor test were used for data collection and the results reveal that openness to experience is a most significant factor amongst big five inventory’s variables and prepared model from linear regression able to show a 0.58 accuracy. Study for extended to predict the depression in the form of high, medium and low chances of person is depressed. Naïve bayes and decision tree model have provided 0.61 and 0.72 accuracy on test dataset respectively.

# Project Introduction
	What is Emotional Intelligence and why to study EQ having already IQ as a measure of intelligence?

Life is an inherently sociable construct, without the ability to function well within this relational environment, it’s doubtful how far intelligence alone will get one. 
EQ as a driver of success applies in the workplace also. As per the study, people with average IQ’s outperform those with the highest IQs 70% of the time. And 75% of careers are derailed for reasons related to emotional competencies, including the inability to handle interpersonal problems; unsatisfactory team leadership during times of difficulty or conflict; or inability to adapt to change or elicit trust.

	Need for predicting emotional intelligence:

Emotional intelligence calculation isn’t straight forward so, it can’t be easily measured. There could be a various factor which directly impact person’s emotional intelligence. Among which, human behaviour may be the main reason for which his/her personality trait is used under observation.

	How personality traits be taking under consideration for predictive analytics?

In psychological trait theory, the Big Five personality traits, also known as the five-factor model (FFM) will be used for measuring human behaviour. FEM contains factors named as the theory identifies five factors:

openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/callous)
neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)

Above mentioned five factors will be our independent variables for regression model.
Problem statement

Having a high IQ should not always justify the success because of unpredictable human life behaviour under critical circumstances. EQ is a tool checking emotional intelligence which is a key criterion in highly competitive environment, because the constraints in precise calculation of emotional intelligence, effect of various factors are studied. Human’s personality traits could be a key impact factor in their psychological well-beings.

	Main focus group of study

Study will be main focused on youth as seen in pandemic situation students suffered a lot due to uncertainties and sometimes impacted heavily at an emotional and psychological levels.
And the necessary for high EQ is because in a critical situation freshers or students have to keep their emotional level controlled as they are facing first time real working environment risks and its behaviour. 
Possibility of high variation in EQ, study will be conducted only for the people aged between 20-24 who are switching their teaching domain to working domain. Also, main reason for narrowing our focus is to reduce the difficulty in data collections.
